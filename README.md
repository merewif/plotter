### Character module

Plotter's character module helps you brainstorm about who your characters are. When you create a new character you are given four writing prompts that help you think about your character's **physical appearance**, their **goals and struggles**, their **flaws and virtues** and their **style of talking and speech patterns**. You can fill or modify the answers to the four prompts any time after the character creation, but it is recommended that you spend 30 minutes on the character creation process and answer all the four prompts in a single session. This way you'll give yourself enough time to immerse yourself in the character creation process.

### Plot module

Plotter's plot module helps you visualize the plot of your novel(s). Create a book, then use the **Set story arcs** option to create line charts that represent the changes in the stakes of your plot. By setting up your story arcs you'll be able to visualize the various stages of your story - the points of tension and relief that ebb and flow as the story moves forward. You can set the story arcs for **every book** and seperately **every chapter** of your book.

Once you open the story arc of a book or a chapter, you can also define the short summary of the story the line chart represents. Write a short, one-sentence summary about who does what to whom, when, where, how and why in the chapter and in the book as a whole. This will help you in defining a clearly delineated plot to center your storytelling around.

### Worldbuilding module

Plotter's worldbuilding module consists of 12 categories of world elements. When you create an entry in a category, you are given a list of writing prompts that will help you define and deepen the world you are creating. These questions were carefully curated to make sure you develop all the various implications of your universe and to help you in forming a comprehensive understanding of your story.

### Moodboard

The Moodboard accompanies all three of Plotter's modules. Each worldbuilding entry, every character, book and chapter has its own seperate Moodboard that you can use to collect the visual references and inspirations that are linked to your ideas. Use it to create collages that fire up your creativity and flood your mind with ideas!
